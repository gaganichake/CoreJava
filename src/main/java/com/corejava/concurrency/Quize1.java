 * 
 * Question: Can you pass a Thread object to Executor.execute? Would such an invocation make sense?
 * 
 * Answer: Thread implements the Runnable interface, so you can pass an instance of Thread to 
 * Executor.execute. However, it doesn't make sense to use Thread objects this way. If the object
 * is directly instantiated from Thread, its run method doesn't do anything. You can define a 
 * subclass of Thread with a useful run method â€” but such a class would implement features that 
 * the executor would not use.
